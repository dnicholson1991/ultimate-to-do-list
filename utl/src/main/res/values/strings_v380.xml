        <![CDATA[
            <p>This plugin works with the <a href=
                \'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\'
                >Tasker</a> automation app.  It allows you to automate some common tasks. For
                example, after missing a call, a to-do item could be created to call the person
                back.</p>
            <p>The following actions are supported.  These can be triggered when events occur that
                you specify.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a new to-do item. You can specify the title, note, dates,
                    reminder, repeating pattern, folder, and many other fields.</li>
                <li>Mark a to-do item as complete.</li>
                <li>Display a to-do list of your choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The plugin also provides a Tasker event which will be triggered when a to-do item of
                your choice is marked as complete. Upon the completion of the to-do item, you can
                have Tasker perform a series of actions.</p>
            <p>Variable replacement is also supported in the title and note fields of to-do
                items. For example, you can include %CNAME in the title to insert the name of
                the last person who called.</p>
            <p>IMPORTANT: If your device runs Android 10 or
                later and you want Tasker to be able to launch a to-do list, you will need to give
                Ultimate To-Do List permission to draw over other apps. You can do this in the Apps area
                of your system settings.</p>

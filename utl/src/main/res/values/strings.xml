	    \nTo navigate through your lists, open the navigation drawer by tapping on the button at the 
	    top-left corner of your screen, or swiping from the left side of the screen towards the middle.  You
	    can access the navigation drawer while viewing any list of tasks or notes.  Note that the drawer may 
	    always be visible if you have a tablet device.\n
	    
	    \nTo create a task or note, just tap on the + button.  In general, if you\'re not sure what a button 
	    does, press and hold your finger on it until a message pops up to tell you.\n
	    
	    \nIf you need help, just tap on the Help button from the navigation drawer.  Many useful resources
	    are available, including the ability to search our support articles.\n
	    
	    \nUltimate To-Do List is highly customizable.  If you\'re feeling overwhelmed with the number of 
	    features, you can turn off features you don\'t need in the settings area.  The settings area also
	    lets you customize the display, reminder, sync, and editing options.
